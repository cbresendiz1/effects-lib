When checking right hand side of Effects2.handle with expected type
        the (Type -> Type) res a ->
        e t (the (Type -> Type) res a) (the (Type -> t -> Type) resk a) ->
        ((x : t) -> resk a x -> m a) -> m a

Type mismatch between
        the (Type -> Type) res2 a ->
        e t (the (Type -> Type) res2 a) (the (Type -> t -> Type) resk1 a) ->
        ((x : t) -> resk1 a x -> m a) -> m a (Type of meth t)
and
        res a ->
        e t (res a) (resk a) ->
        ((x : t) -> resk a x -> m a) -> m a (Expected type)

Specifically:
        Type mismatch between
                Type -> t -> Type
        and
                res a
